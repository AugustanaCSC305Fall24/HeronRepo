{"name":"Operation Silent Echo","description":"In a world of digital communication, a powerful storm has knocked out all modern lines of communication in a remote mountain region. Emergency services are relying solely on amateur radio operators using CW (Morse code) to coordinate search-and-rescue efforts. The task is urgent: survivors are scattered, and each bot has a critical piece of information or a unique task to contribute to the operation. You must work with the bots to decode messages, \nrelay them accurately, and achieve the mission objectives before the storm clears.","notes":"Players should use proper CW protocols when interacting with bots.","botsDetails":[{"name":"SkyWatcher","objective":"Relay weather updates to keep the team informed about the storm\u0027s development.","isStartingBot":true},{"name":"PathFinder","objective":"Send coordinates for the search-and-rescue teams based on survivor sightings.","isStartingBot":false},{"name":"SignalBear","objective":"Boost signal strength in areas with poor coverage by managing a virtual antenna network.","isStartingBot":false},{"name":"EchoShadow","objective":"Intercept and decode distress signals from survivors or emergency beacons.","isStartingBot":false},{"name":"PulseGuardian","objective":"Monitor the emergency frequency for unauthorized interference and report it.","isStartingBot":false}]}
